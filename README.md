# Motion-Based-Football-Kick-Detection-and-Classification-with-YOLO

1) Environment Setup
•	Installing Libraries: To enable deep learning-based object detection and motion analysis capabilities, install torch, opencv-python, and ultralytics (for YOLOv8) using pip.
•	Cloning Repository: To view the model and its settings for YOLOv5, clone the YOLOv5 repository from GitHub.
•	Imports: Import the YOLO class from ultralytics for YOLOv8, torch for deep learning operations, and cv2 for handling video input and processing.
•	YOLOv5 Model Setup: Load the YOLOv5 model directly from the repository using torch.hub.

2) Model Initialization
•	YOLOv5: Use torch.hub.load to load the YOLOv5 model, specifying the desired version (e.g., yolov5s). This initializes the YOLOv5 model with pre-trained weights for football motion detection.
•	YOLOv8: Load the YOLOv8 model using YOLO('yolov8s.pt'). YOLOv8 provides enhanced speed and accuracy, making it suitable for real-time kick detection with quicker inference times.

3) Video Input Handling
•	Video Input: Use cv2 to open the video stream using cv2.VideoCapture and specify the path to the input video.
•	Extract Video Attributes: Obtain video attributes such as height, width, and frame rate (fps), which are crucial for maintaining video quality during processing and output.
•	Output Configuration: Define output video parameters like codec (fourcc), which controls the encoding of the output video, ensuring the processed video maintains a smooth playback quality.

4) Processing
•	Reading Video Frames: Continuously read frames from the video until the stream ends, using cap.read() to ensure each frame is processed while monitoring for end-of-stream conditions.
•	Model-Specific Detection: Pass each frame through the YOLOv5 model and use results to extract detected objects, including bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores.
•	YOLOv8: For YOLOv8, send each frame through the model, which produces class labels, confidence scores, and bounding box coordinates for detected objects, including football kicks.

5) Object Filtering and Annotation
•	Object Filtering: Iterate through detected objects in each frame and filter based on the desired class label (e.g., "football kick" or similar).
•	Extract Coordinates: Retrieve coordinates, label, and confidence score for each detected object.
•	Drawing Annotations: Use cv2.rectangle to draw bounding boxes around detected kicks and cv2.putText to add text annotations indicating the detected class and its confidence score.
•	Consistency in Annotation: The annotation process for YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 is similar, with minor differences in output formats.

6) Displaying Output Frames
•	Color Conversion: Convert frames from BGR to RGB using cv2.cvtColor to adhere to display color standards.
•	Frame Display: Temporarily save each processed frame and use Python to display them in a notebook environment, providing a visual preview of the detection in real-time.

7) User Interaction and Control
•	Manual Control: Allow users to manually end the frame processing loop by pressing the "q" key, offering flexibility for debugging or stopping the video processing as needed.
•	Flow Control: This feature helps manage the flow of video processing, making it easier to intervene during testing.

8) Resource Management
•	Release Resources: Once video processing is complete, release the video stream using cap.release() to free up allocated resources.
•	Clean-Up: Use cv2.destroyAllWindows() to close any open display windows, ensuring no system resources are left hanging.
